# 🔧 Registration Issue - FIXED!

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
Your frontend API routes were using hardcoded `http://localhost:5000` URLs instead of your Azure backend, causing 500 errors during registration.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **Files Fixed:**
- `frontend/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Registration endpoint
- `frontend/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Login endpoint  
- All admin API routes (`/api/admin/*`)
- All provider API routes (`/api/provider/*`)
- Provider API library (`frontend/src/lib/providerAPI.ts`)

### **Changes Made:**
**Before:**
```typescript
const backendResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register', {
```

**After:**
```typescript
const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://solutilconnect-backend-api-g6g4hhb2eeh7hjep.southafricanorth-01.azurewebsites.net'
const backendResponse = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/api/auth/register`, {
```

## 🚀 **What Happens Next:**

1. **✅ Code pushed to GitHub** - Your changes are deployed
2. **⏳ Vercel auto-deployment** - Your frontend is rebuilding with the fixes
3. **✅ Registration will work** - Once deployment completes (2-3 minutes)

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment:**

### **Wait 2-3 minutes then test:**
1. Visit your live site: `https://www.solutilconnect.com`
2. Try to **register a new account**
3. Try to **login with existing account**

### **Expected Result:**
✅ Registration should work without 500 errors  
✅ Login should work properly  
✅ All API calls should go to your Azure backend  

### **How to Verify Fix:**
Open browser DevTools → Network tab → Try registration
- Should see requests to `solutilconnect-backend-api-g6g4hhb2eeh7hjep.southafricanorth-01.azurewebsites.net`
- Should get 200/201 success responses

## 📊 **Root Cause:**
The issue was that your frontend Next.js API routes were acting as proxies but were hardcoded to forward requests to localhost instead of using environment variables to determine the backend URL.

## 🎉 **Status:**
**FIXED** - Frontend will connect to Azure backend after deployment completes!
