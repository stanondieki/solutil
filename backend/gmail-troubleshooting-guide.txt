ðŸ“§ GMAIL DELIVERY TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

âœ… IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. CHECK SPAM FOLDER:
   â€¢ Look in Gmail spam/junk folder
   â€¢ Search for "SolUtil", "Email Test", or "infosolu31"
   â€¢ If found, click "Not Spam" on all emails

2. ADD TO CONTACTS:
   â€¢ Add infosolu31@gmail.com to your Gmail contacts
   â€¢ This tells Gmail the sender is trusted

3. CHECK ALL GMAIL SECTIONS:
   â€¢ Primary inbox
   â€¢ Promotions tab
   â€¢ Spam folder  
   â€¢ All Mail folder
   â€¢ Search "from:infosolu31@gmail.com"

4. GMAIL SETTINGS CHECK:
   â€¢ Gmail Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses
   â€¢ Make sure infosolu31@gmail.com is not blocked
   â€¢ Check forwarding settings

âœ… ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHODS:

1. USE CONSOLE VERIFICATION (Immediate):
   - Set USE_REAL_SMTP=false in .env
   - Restart backend
   - Register/resend verification
   - Copy URL from backend console
   - Paste in browser to verify

2. USE DIFFERENT EMAIL:
   - Try with Yahoo: yourname@yahoo.com
   - Try with Outlook: yourname@outlook.com
   - These might have better delivery

3. MANUAL VERIFICATION:
   - We can manually verify your account in database
   - Skip email verification for testing

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:

The emails ARE being sent successfully:
â€¢ SMTP connection works âœ…
â€¢ Gmail accepts emails (250 OK responses) âœ…  
â€¢ Messages get Message IDs âœ…

But Gmail's internal filtering might be:
â€¢ Moving emails to spam automatically
â€¢ Categorizing them differently
â€¢ Applying content filters
â€¢ Having delivery delays

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS:

1. Check spam folder first (most likely solution)
2. If not there, try console verification mode
3. Add sender to contacts for future emails
4. Consider using a different email service

The system is working correctly - it's just Gmail's aggressive filtering!
