## ðŸ”§ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Backend Deployment (Azure App Service)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced services API and migrated provider services to ProviderService collection"

# Deploy to Azure (if using Azure DevOps)
git push origin main

# OR manually zip and upload to Azure App Service
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory  
cd ../frontend

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update: Frontend to use enhanced services API endpoints"

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# OR deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

Make sure your production environment has:

```bash
# Backend (.env.production)
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://solutilconnect_db_user:VaZbj1WZvT0gyUp0@solutilconnect.7o4tjqy.mongodb.net/solutilconnect_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=solutilconnect
PORT=8000

# Frontend (.env.production)  
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://solutilconnect-backend-api-g6g4hhb2eeh7hjep.southafricanorth-01.azurewebsites.net
```

## âœ¨ NEW API ENDPOINTS

### Enhanced Services API:
- `GET /api/v2/services` - Get all active services
- `GET /api/v2/services/:id` - Get service details  
- `GET /api/v2/services/search` - Search services
- `GET /api/v2/services/my-services` - Provider's services (auth required)

### Legacy API (Still works):
- `GET /api/services` - Legacy services
- `GET /api/provider-services/public` - Legacy provider services

## ðŸ§ª TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Dashboard shows services âœ…
- [ ] Services page loads providers âœ…  
- [ ] Booking flow works âœ…

## ðŸš¨ ROLLBACK PLAN
