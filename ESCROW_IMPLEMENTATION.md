MPESA_BUSINESS_SHORTCODE=174379
MPESA_PASSKEY=your_passkey
MPESA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox // or production
```

## 🔄 **Updated Dashboard Navigation**
- Service cards now navigate to `/booking?service=serviceName`
- Pre-selects service type for faster booking
- Removed modal dependency for better UX

## 📊 **Database Schema Updates**

### **EscrowPayment Collection**
```javascript
{
  checkoutRequestID: String,
  amount: Number,
  commissionAmount: Number,
  providerAmount: Number,
  status: String,
  bookingId: ObjectId,
  clientId: ObjectId,
  providerId: ObjectId,
  rating: Number,

  events: [EventSchema]
}
```

## 🚀 **API Endpoints**

### **M-Pesa Payments**
- `POST /api/payments/mpesa/stk-push` - Initiate payment
- `POST /api/payments/mpesa/callback` - M-Pesa callback
- `GET /api/payments/mpesa/status/:id` - Check payment status
- `POST /api/payments/mpesa/release/:id` - Release escrow
- `POST /api/payments/mpesa/dispute/:id` - Initiate dispute

### **Booking Management**
- `POST /api/bookings/:id/complete` - Complete booking
- `POST /api/bookings/:id/dispute` - Dispute booking

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Full Implementation**

### 1. **Frontend Integration**
- Update existing booking page to use new components
- Add provider selection step to booking flow
- Integrate payment components

### 2. **Database Connection**
- Connect EscrowPayment model to actual database
- Remove mock data and connect to real APIs
- Add proper error handling

### 3. **M-Pesa Configuration**
- Set up M-Pesa developer account
- Configure callback URLs
- Test in sandbox environment

### 4. **Testing**
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for payment flow
- End-to-end testing

### 5. **Production Setup**
- SSL certificates for callbacks
- Production M-Pesa credentials
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and recovery

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**
- All payments are held in escrow until completion
- Client confirmation required for payment release
- Dispute system protects both parties
- Audit trail for all transactions
- Rate limiting on payment endpoints

## 💰 **Revenue Model**
- 10% commission on all completed transactions
- Commission only taken on successful completions
- Transparent fee structure
- Automatic commission calculation
