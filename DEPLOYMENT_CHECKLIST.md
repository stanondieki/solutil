## üß™ Test Scenarios to Verify After Deployment

### Payment Flow Tests
1. **Successful Payment:**

   - Backend server down

### Mobile Testing
4. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Provider cards should not overflow
   - Payment popup should work on mobile

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Vercel Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
# These should be set in Vercel dashboard, not committed to code
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_954e0aa0aad2caffbe6b31bd55eb48f8e2e45a55
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_9f8128f9735c56f9cbaa9bfa636215c21d4483bc
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.azurewebsites.net
```

### Azure Backend Environment Variables
```bash
# These should be set in Azure App Service Configuration
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_9f8128f9735c56f9cbaa9bfa636215c21d4483bc
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_954e0aa0aad2caffbe6b31bd55eb48f8e2e45a55
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch After Deployment

1. **Test the full payment flow** on live site
2. **Check console logs** for any errors
3. **Verify mobile experience** 
4. **Test terms validation**
5. **Monitor for any backend connection issues**

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Previous version is still deployed
2. Can quickly revert environment variables
3. Database changes are minimal and non-breaking

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

Test these URLs after deployment:
- [ ] https://solutil.vercel.app/book-service (booking flow)
- [ ] Backend health check
- [ ] Payment popup opens correctly
- [ ] Terms validation works
- [ ] Mobile layout is proper
